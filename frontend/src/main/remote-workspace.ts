// Connecting the supervisor to a remote workspace's daemon.
//
// The whole feature rests on one fact: the renderer addresses the daemon
// through a single mutable base URL that the supervisor hands it
// (`daemon:status` → renderer/lib/daemon-status.ts), and the terminal-mux
// WebSocket derives its URL from that same base. So if the supervisor points
// that base at a loopback port which SSH forwards to the remote daemon, every
// existing renderer feature — REST, SSE, terminals — works unmodified, and the
// remote daemon keeps its 127.0.0.1-only bind. AO gains no network listener,
// and `AGENTS.md`'s bind rule is respected on both machines.
//
// Connect sequence, in order, because each step's failure has a different
// remedy and must not be reported as the next step's:
//
//   1. preflight  — is `ssh` here, is the host reachable, is `ao` there
//   2. discover   — read the remote run-file for a LIVE daemon and its real port
//   3. start      — only if none, launch `ao daemon` detached, then re-discover
//   4. tunnel     — `ssh -N -L <local>:127.0.0.1:<discovered>`
//   5. wait       — probe the forward until /healthz and /readyz agree
//
// The port is discovered, never assumed. `AO_PORT` is only a *request*: when it
// is taken the daemon binds an ephemeral port instead and records the real one
// in ~/.ao/running.json (the same handshake the local supervisor trusts).
// Forwarding to a guessed 3001 on a busy host reaches whatever else is
// listening there, not AO.
//
// Process plumbing lives here; the argv builders and the failure taxonomy are
// pure modules under shared/ so they can be tested without opening a socket.
